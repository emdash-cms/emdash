# HANDOVER

## 1) Purpose

This repository is an EmDash plugin monorepo; the current active work is the commerce plugin in `packages/plugins/commerce`. The product goal is to keep catalog read and write behavior correct and performant while preserving the existing checkout/finalization kernel behavior.

The immediate objective is to continue external-review-driven hardening. Priority is minimal, proven fixes with tests, no speculative scope expansion, and no changes to the finalize/payment contracts unless required by correctness or data integrity findings.

## 2) Completed work and outcomes

The latest review cycle completed three concrete stages:
1. read-path batching refactor in `packages/plugins/commerce/src/handlers/catalog.ts` to reduce N+1 query patterns for product listing/detail reads, with batch loaders for categories, tags, images, variant options, entitlements, and component hydration.
2. cross-layer coupling cleanup by moving `inventoryStockDocId` to `packages/plugins/commerce/src/lib/inventory-stock.ts` and updating call sites so catalog/lib code no longer imports this helper from finalization internals.
3. regression fixes after test failures, including a stable `getMany` dispatch path and consistent tuple typing in batch hydration to keep in-memory test collections compatible with new helpers.

All changed areas were validated by tests. Current tip is commit `3c1262f` (after commits `2381def` and `7cdd4ce`), with full repo test pass and commerce package test pass at time of handoff.

## 3) Failures, open issues, and lessons learned

The latest test run initially failed in commerce due to a parse issue in a batched tuple return and then a test-double binding issue when calling optional `getMany` methods unbound. Both were fixed in code with minimal edits; no functional behavior changed outside batching and helper placement.

As of now there are no known failing tests and no blocking runtime regressions reported from the recent runs. Review feedback still labels `catalog.ts` as a long-term concentration point (many responsibilities in one file); no further split was performed to avoid architecture churn.

Lesson: keep helper contracts broad enough for both real storage and test doubles, and avoid unbound function extraction from collection-like objects.

## 4) Files changed, key insights, and gotchas

Priority files to review first:
- `packages/plugins/commerce/src/handlers/catalog.ts` — batching refactor, read-path consolidation, and latest compatibility fix.
- `packages/plugins/commerce/src/handlers/catalog.test.ts` — in-memory collection gained `getMany` to exercise batching path.
- `packages/plugins/commerce/src/lib/inventory-stock.ts` — shared `inventoryStockDocId`.
- `packages/plugins/commerce/src/orchestration/finalize-payment-inventory.ts` — imports/re-exports shared helper.
- `packages/plugins/commerce/src/lib/catalog-order-snapshots.ts` — switched to shared inventory helper.
- `packages/plugins/commerce/src/lib/checkout-inventory-validation.ts` — switched to shared inventory helper.

Key gotchas:
- `getManyByIds` calls should use a bound `collection` path; avoid passing method references directly where `this` is required.
- `loadProductsReadMetadata` expects product IDs and returns map entries with complete tuple shapes; keep return shape stable.
- Keep catalog batching changes isolated and regression-tested in `catalog.test.ts`.
- Do not alter inventory ID encoding (`stock:${encodeURIComponent(productId)}:${encodeURIComponent(variantId)}`) without updating snapshot/finalization expectations.
