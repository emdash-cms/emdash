"emdash": patch
---

Fixes the visual editing toolbar's "Open in admin" so each entry gets its own admin window. The window name was a single constant shared by the whole site, so opening the admin for one entry navigated away from another already open in that tab. A repeat click on the same entry still reuses that entry's window.
