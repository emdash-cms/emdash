"emdash": patch

Fixes plugin storage `uniqueIndexes` rejecting duplicate field values in unrelated plugins and collections. Uniqueness now applies only to the collection that declares it, while indexed lookups remain available. A database migration repairs existing tracked unique indexes, including those left by plugins removed from configuration; no manual index cleanup is needed.
