"emdash": patch

Fixes admin media uploads skipping `media:beforeUpload` and `media:afterUpload` plugin hooks. Plugins can validate, rename, change the file type, or cancel uploads before they are accepted, and receive a notification after a new media item becomes ready. Filename and type changes are validated; the upload size stays tied to the original client bytes.
