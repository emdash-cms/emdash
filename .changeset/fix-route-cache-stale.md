Fixes Cloudflare-cached pages remaining outdated after content is deleted or unpublished. Pages using EmDash cache hints no longer send an automatic `Last-Modified` header, so Cloudflare stops answering `304 Not Modified` based on an entry timestamp that does not cover related lists or settings changes. This applies to entry, collection, publication-date, and reference-list hints. Sites using an object cache reload those content snapshots once after upgrading so cached validators from earlier versions are not reused.

Taxonomy definitions and collection-to-taxonomy mappings also revalidate in the background after 30 seconds, so long-lived server processes pick up changes saved elsewhere without adding a blocking query to each render. A failed refresh retains the last good snapshot.

#### What should I do?

`cacheHint.lastModified` is no longer populated automatically. For an entry's displayed modification date, use `entry.data.updatedAt` instead; it is not a validator for the whole page.

Pages relying on automatic validators also lose Astro's implicit `Cache-Control: no-cache` header. Set your own browser `Cache-Control` if you need a fresh check on every visit. If you want conditional requests, supply a custom `lastModified` hint to `Astro.cache.set()`. Its timestamp must advance whenever any part of the response changes, including settings, related entries, deletions, and unpublishes.
