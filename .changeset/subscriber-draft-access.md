Restricts Subscriber-role access to draft, scheduled, and trashed content. Subscribers retain `content:read` for member-only published content but no longer see non-published items via the REST API or MCP server. Adds a new `content:read_drafts` permission (Contributor and above) that gates `/compare`, `/revisions`, `/trash`, `/preview-url`, and the corresponding MCP tools.
