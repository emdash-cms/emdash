"emdash": patch

Fixes entry creation, entry saves and content-list search failing with `no such column` in a collection that has a reference field marked `searchable`. Adding such a field to a search-enabled collection failed, and after a seed turned search on, creating or saving any entry in that collection failed. Site search and content-list search now ignore the `searchable` flag on a reference field bound to a relation.

#### What should I do?

If creating or saving entries in a collection still fails after upgrading and the server log shows `no such column`, open the collection under **Content Types**, untick **Search** and save, then tick it again and save. This rebuilds the collection's search index.
