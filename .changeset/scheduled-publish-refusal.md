Fixes a scheduled entry that publishing refuses staying overdue forever. When the scheduler's publish fails with a validation error or a slug conflict, the entry is now unscheduled and the dashboard lists it with the error message, as it already does when a plugin rejects a scheduled publish. Before, the error went only to the server log, the scheduler retried it on every run, and the calendar said scheduled publishing might not be running.
