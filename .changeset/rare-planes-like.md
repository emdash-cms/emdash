Fixes captions being omitted from image field values and their generated TypeScript types. Image selection, content saves, and seed export/import preserve captions, including explicitly empty captions. Seed exports keep library defaults separately from per-use captions. Image and focal-point edits retain per-use captions unless the caption is explicitly edited. Templates should read the top-level `caption`; the legacy `meta.caption` alias stays consistent when present.
