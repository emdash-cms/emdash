"emdash": patch
---

Load `EMDASH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` from the project `.env` into `process.env` during `astro dev`. This lets freshly scaffolded Node.js sites save plugin settings declared with `type: "secret"` without first exporting the `.env` file into the shell. Existing environment variables are honored and never overwritten; other EmDash variables are not copied so that `.env` values intended for production do not override generated dev values.
