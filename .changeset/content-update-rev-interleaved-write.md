"emdash": patch
---

Fixes `PUT /_emdash/api/content/{collection}/{id}` so a save that carries `_rev` can no longer overwrite a change another writer saved while the request was being processed. The token was checked once against the first read of the entry, and a save that landed before the entry was read again for the write went unnoticed. The version used by the write is now checked against `_rev` as well, and a mismatch returns `409 CONFLICT`. Saves without `_rev` are unchanged.
