"emdash": patch
---

Warns when a seed file's `repeater` field has no `validation.subFields`, or declares its sub-fields under `fields` instead. Such a repeater previously seeded without any warning, and the admin then showed rows labelled "Item 1", "Item 2" with no inputs to edit. `emdash seed` prints the warning naming the field, and `validateSeed()` returns it in `warnings`; the seed still applies as before. The setup wizard does not display seed warnings.
