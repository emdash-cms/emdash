# Investigate bot

Experimental Flue-powered investigation bot for `emdash-cms/emdash` issues. Runs as a GitHub Actions workflow when a maintainer applies the `bot:repro` label. Not deployed as a Cloudflare Worker.

For the design rationale, see the [PR description](https://github.com/emdash-cms/emdash/pull/1090). Astro's analogous setup (`.flue/agents/issue-triage.ts` in `withastro/astro`) is the closest reference.

## What it does

When a maintainer adds `bot:repro` to an issue:

1. **Classify** — kimi-k2.6 decides issue kind/area/whether a browser is needed.
2. **Reproduce** — opus runs in a `local()` sandbox on the GH Actions runner. Picks one of three sub-skills:
   - `repro-api` — `pnpm test`, CLI commands, direct API hits, no browser
   - `repro-admin` — `agent-browser` against `pnpm dev` with the dev-bypass auth shortcut
   - `repro-public` — `agent-browser` against the rendered public site
3. **Diagnose** — read the source paths that explain the symptom, rate confidence in the root cause, choose a fix approach (`mechanical` / `clear-best-option` / `needs-design-decision`), and write a concrete proposed fix.
4. **Verify** — decide whether the behaviour is a bug or intended-by-design. Gates the fix stage.
5. **Fix** — conditional on `verdict=bug`, `confidence!=low`, and `fixApproach!=needs-design-decision`. Runs on a cheaper coding model (kimi-k2.7-code) in its own session — diagnose already produced the plan, so this stage is guided implementation. Writes the change, runs the reproduce test, the broader package tests, typecheck, lint, format. Stages but does not commit.

The orchestrator (`.github/workflows/investigate.yml`) reads the structured JSON output and performs all GitHub writes — labels, comments, branch pushes, PR creation. The agent itself has no write access to GitHub.

## Trigger and label state

| Label                      | Set by     | Meaning                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bot:repro`                | Maintainer | Investigation requested                                      |
| `triage/reproducing`       | Bot        | Investigation in progress                                    |
| `triage/reproduced`        | Bot        | Confirmed bug; needs a maintainer (no fix, or fix abandoned) |
| `triage/by-design`         | Bot        | Reproduced, but the behaviour appears intentional            |
| `triage/awaiting-reporter` | Bot        | Fix pushed; reporter asked to verify                         |
| `triage/verified`          | Bot        | Reporter confirmed; PR opened                                |
| `triage/not-reproduced`    | Bot        | Could not observe the reported behaviour                     |
| `triage/skipped`           | Bot        | Declined (non-bug, requires external data, etc.)             |
| `triage/failed`            | Bot        | Gave up after retries                                        |

The bot owns every label except `bot:repro`. Maintainers don't manage state directly — they trigger by adding `bot:repro` and re-trigger by removing/re-adding it.

## Token model

Two distinct tokens per investigation, mirroring `withastro/astro`'s split:

- **Sandbox token** (`AGENT_GH_TOKEN`): default `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`, scoped to `contents: read, issues: read` via the job's `permissions:`. The only token in `local({ env })`. The agent's bash can clone the repo and run `gh issue view`; it cannot comment, label, or push.
- **Orchestrator token**: a GitHub App installation token minted by `actions/create-github-app-token`, scoped to `issues: write, contents: write, pull-requests: write` on this repo only. Lives in the workflow YAML and is used for all writes. Never crosses into the sandbox env.

A complete jailbreak of the agent's bash cannot escalate to comment, label, branch-push, or PR-create writes — those require the orchestrator token, which the sandbox never sees.

## Local prototyping

The `prototype` script invokes the real Flue workflow against a fixture issue and dumps the structured result. No GitHub writes — the orchestrator that does writes lives in the YAML.

```bash
cd .flue
pnpm install

# Cloudflare AI Gateway creds (same secrets bonk.yml and review.yml use)
export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
export CLOUDFLARE_GATEWAY_ID=...
export CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY=...

# GitHub read-only token for the sandbox's `gh issue view`
export AGENT_GH_TOKEN=...  # or GITHUB_TOKEN / GH_TOKEN — the script picks any

# Run against a saved fixture (under .flue/fixtures/)
pnpm prototype 1021

# Or against a live issue
pnpm prototype --live 1183

# Try a different model
FLUE_INVESTIGATE_MODEL=cloudflare-ai-gateway/claude-sonnet-4-6 pnpm prototype 1021
```

The fixtures directory holds five real issues from the queue (#1021, #1042, #1046, #1049, #1080) so prompt iteration can happen without burning live `gh` API quota.

## One-time setup (when this lands on `main`)

1. **GitHub App.** The bot uses an existing App (the same one `bonk.yml`, `review.yml`, `release.yml`, `auto-format.yml` use). The `APP_ID` and `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` repository secrets already exist. The App's installation must include the `issues: write`, `contents: write`, and `pull_requests: write` permissions on `emdash-cms/emdash`.
2. **Labels.** `investigate.yml`'s first step does `gh label create --force` for each of the eight `bot:*` labels. No manual setup needed; the labels appear after the first run.
3. **GitHub Project board (optional).** Create a project in the UI with one column per `bot:*` label and a saved query like `repo:emdash-cms/emdash label:triage/reproducing` per column. The bot moves labels; cards follow automatically. Not required for the bot to function.

## What this PR does not do

- No Cloudflare Worker is deployed.
- No `app.ts`, no `wrangler.jsonc`.
- No `/repro` or `/verify` slash commands. Triggers are labels and comment replies only.
- No auto-fire on every new issue. The bot only runs when a maintainer explicitly requests it.
- No auto-merging or auto-PR-opening without reporter verification.
